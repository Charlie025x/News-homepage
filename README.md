## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to reorder grid items when the screen size changes, and I also learned how to make an animated nav menu for mobile devices.

### Continued development

I realized that I have overlooked css animations until now, and now I'd like to work on animating html items to fade or float into place when they appear on the screen on scroll.

### Useful resources

- [How to make a responsive navbar with react js and tailwind css | React js and tailwind css tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ys-dT94mA) - This video tutorial was a great starting point on getting my navbar up and running.
- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=1283s) - This video by Kevin helped me with reordering my grid items into place between mobile and desktop viewports.
